 <h4> Surrendur:</h4> <font class="h6">Payment In Case Of Surrender</font> 
    Surrender value is determined by LIC policy surrender processing time. There are 2 types of surrenders available. Let’s check them out:
    
    Guaranteed Surrender Value (GSV)
    Under the guaranteed surrender value, the policyholder can surrender their policy only after the completion of 3 years. This means that the premium has to be paid for a minimum period of 3 years. If you surrender after 3 years, the surrender value will be around 30% of the premiums paid till date. However, this is excluding the premium paid in the first year and the premiums paid towards accidental benefit riders.
    
    So, the later the policy is surrendered, the higher will be the LIC surrender value.
    
    Special Surrender Value
   <ul>
   It is usually higher than the guaranteed surrender value. This is how special surrender value for LIC policies work –<br></br>
    
   If you pay premiums for more than 3 years but less than 4, you get up to 80% of maturity sum assured.<br></br>
    
    If you pay premiums for more than 4 years but less than 5, you get up to 90% of maturity sum assured.<br></br>
    
   If you pay premiums for more than 5 years, you get up to 100% of maturity sum assured.<br></br>
    
    The maturity sum assured will be calculated based on how much premiums have been paid. It will be calculated as –<br></br>
    
    (Original sum assured *(number of premiums paid/ number of premium payable) + total bonus received) * surrender value factor.<br></br>
    
   <font class="h6">An Alternative to LIC Policy Surrender</font> <br></br>
    Instead of surrendering your LIC policy, you can stop paying premiums but continue your life cover. This is when the policy becomes a paid-up policy. Under a paid-up policy, the sum assured decreases. This reduced sum assured is called paid-up value.
    <br></br>
    The life cover goes on till the end of the policy term. On death or maturity of the LIC policy, the reduced sum assured or the paid-up value is offered.
    <br></br>
    Paid-up Value versus Surrender Value<br></br>
    As we can see that paid-up value and surrender value sounds quite similar. So, here is a table that will help you get a clarity between these two:
</ul>
  <br></br>
 <h4> Maturity:</h4><p> <font class="h6">Claims settlement procedure:</font> <br></br>

    The settlement of claims is a very important aspect of service to the policyholders. Hence, the Corporation has laid great emphasis on expeditious settlement of Maturity as well as Death Claims.
                       <br></br>
    The procedure for settlement of maturity and death claims is detailed below :
    <br></br>
    Maturity Claims:<br></br>
    1) In case of Endowment type of Policies, amount is payable at the end of the policy period. The Branch Office which services the policy sends out a letter informing the date on which the policy monies are payable to the policyholder at least two months before the due date of payment. The policyholder is requested to return the Discharge Form duly completed along with the Policy Document, NEFT Mandate Form (Bank A/c Particulars with supporting proof), KYC requirements etc. . On receipt of these documents payment is processed in advance so that maturity amount gets credited to the policyholder’s bank A/C on the due date.
    <br></br>
    2) Some Plans like Money Back Policies provide for periodical payments to the policyholders provided premium due under the policies are paid up to the anniversary due for Survival Benefit. In these cases where amount payable is up to Rs.500,000/-,payments are released without calling for the Discharge Receipt or Policy Document. Survival Benefit under Jeevan Anand policies up to Sum assured Rs. 200000/- is also released without calling for policy bond or discharge form. However, in case of higher amounts these two requirements are insisted upon.

 <br></br>
 <h4>Bonus:</h4><p><font class="h6"> How Much Bonus Will You Get? </font>- LIC Bonus Calculator<br></br>
    In LIC, the simple reversionary bonus rates are used to declare bonuses rates. This implies that the bonus rates are not compounded. These bonus rates will be valid for Rs. 1000 Sum Assured for the plan in question for that year.
    <br></br>
    For instance, let us say that a new endowment plan has Rupees 45 on a sum assured of Rupees 1000 for a tenure of 21 years. So suppose the policy has a sum assured of Rupees 10,00,000. 
    <br></br>
    So, (45/100) x (10,00,000) = Rupees 45,000 will be the bonus for that year. 
    <br></br>
    All the bonuses for the years up to maturity will be added together at maturity to determine the simple reversionary portion of the maturity returns.
    
    </p>
  <br></br>
  <h4>Death Claim:</h4><p>
    The death claim amount is payable in case of policies where premiums are paid up-to-date or where the death occurs within the days of grace. On receipt of intimation of death of the Life Assured the Branch Office calls for the following requirements:
   <br></br>
    a) Claim form A – Claimant’s Statement giving details of the deceased and the claimant. 
    <br></br>
    b) Certified extract from Death Register 
    <br></br>
    c) Documentary proof of age, if age is not admitted 
    <br></br>
    d) Evidence of title to the deceased’s estate if the policy is not nominated, assigned or 
    issued under M.W.P. Act. 
    <br></br>
    e) Original Policy Document 
    <br></br>
    The following additional forms are called for if death occurs within three years from the date of risk or from date of revival/reinstatement.<br></br>
    a) Claim Form B – Medical Attendant’s Certificate to be completed by the Medical Attendant of the deceased during his/her last illness 
    <br></br>
    b) Claim Form B1 – if the life assured received treatment in a hospital 
    <br></br>
    c) Claim form B2 – to be completed by the Medical Attendant who treated the deceased life assured prior to his last illness. 
    <br></br>
    d) Claim Form C – Certificate of Identity and burial or cremation to be completed and signed by a person of known character and responsibility 
    <br></br>
    e) Claim form E – Certificate by Employer if the assured was employed person. 
    <br></br>
    f) Certified copies of the First Information Report, the Post-mortem report and Police Investigation Report if death was due to accident or unnatural cause. 
    These additional forms are required to satisfy ourselves on the genuineness of the claim, i.e., no material information that would have affected our acceptance of proposal has been withheld by the deceased at the time of proposal. Further, these forms also help us at the time of investigation by the officials of the Corporation.
    <br></br>
    Double Accident Benefit Claims:
    Double Accident Benefit is provided as an additional benefit to the life insurance cover. For this purpose an extra premium of Rs.1/- per Rs.1000/- S.A is charged. For claiming the benefits under the Accident Benefit the claimant has to produce the proof to the satisfaction of the Corporation that the accident is defined as per the policy conditions. Normally for claiming this benefit documents like FIR, Post-mortem Report are insisted upon.
    <br></br>
    Disability Benefit Claims:
    Disability benefit claims consist of waiver of future premiums under the policy and extended disability benefit consisting in addition of a monthly benefit payment as per policy conditions. The essential condition for claiming this benefit is that the disability is total and permanent so as to preclude him from earning any wage/compensation or profit as a result of the accident 
    <br></br>
    Claims Review Committees:
    The Corporation settles a large number of Death Claims every year. Only in case of fraudulent suppression of material information is the liability repudiated. This is to ensure that claims are not paid to fraudulent persons at the cost of honest policyholders. The number of Death Claims repudiated is, however, very small. Even in these cases, an opportunity is given to the claimant to make a representation for consideration by the Review Committees of the Zonal office and the Central Office. As a result of such review, depending on the merits of each case, appropriate decisions are taken. The Claims Review Committees of the Central and Zonal Offices have among their Members, a retired High Court/District Court Judge. This has helped providing transparency and confidence in our operations and has resulted in greater satisfaction among claimants, policyholders and public.
